# Library management system - SEB
Project implemented at the University of Synergy. The electronic library system is a user-administrator program for referencing books on a computer, where the reader (user or administrator) can view all books in one place. The administrator and the user have separate interfaces, with different possibilities, also in addition to adding, editing books, reading books (.txt and .pdf formats), various entertainment contents are also available. 

The program works on the principle of user / administrator, where logging in takes place on separate windows in the program, the user with a username and password, and the administrator with a name, surname and password, user registration is also enabled. 

### The administrator has the following capabilities:
* dashboard - display of the number of available books, display of the number of administrators and users added to the electronic library system.
* display of available books in the electronic library system
* adding books to the electronic library system (title, subtitle, author, publisher, publication date and so on and adding a file (.docx, .txt, .pdf, .mp3 and so on) - any file format is available)
* book editing, where there is the possibility of writing a book, or copying text and saving it, there is also an advanced text editor where we can adjust word cases (sentence case, lower case, upper case, wide case, title case, inverse case, reverse case and so on) and we can also convert book text to binary, octal, hexadecimal and morse code, but we can also convert back to text.
* word reader where, in the list, there are all the files that we have added to the electronic library system and if they are in .pdf or .txt format, it is possible to read them and calculate the interestingness of the text, i.e. the number of different words in the text and calculate their frequency in the same, the result can be saved.
* the game room, where we have a display of games and also the number of attempts, i.e. how many times the same game has been played and average player knowledge and game results. Of the games, it has x-ox and literary quiz, we also have question editing, where we edit the question for the quiz and adjust the answers and questions, we can also delete them, the quiz question table, it is also possible to delete the questions we do not need, the status table x -ox, also the quiz standings table, where we have results and player information.
Effects in the form of disappearing squares in different colors appear on the window - animation.
* feedback - a window where we can see all feedback sent by users.
* administrator registration - where we can register a new administrator
* tables of users and administrators, we can also remove users and administrators that we don't need.
*by deleting a user or administrator, they will automatically no longer be able to access their accounts*
